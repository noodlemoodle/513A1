				<h3 class="contentHeader">What is a Wavelet?</h3>
				<p class="contentParagraph" align = "left">
					A wavelet is a rapidly decaying, wave-like oscillation that has zero mean. They are similar to
					sinusoids in appearance, but unlike sinuoids, a wavelet exists only for a finite duration.
					<br>
					Some well know wavelets are:

					<li>Morlet Wavelets</li>
					<li>Daubechies Wavelets</li>
					<li>Coiflets Wavelets</li>
					<li>Biorthogonal Wavelets</li>
					<li>Mexican Hat Wavelets</li>
					<li>Symlets Wavelets</li>

				<h3 class="contentHeader">Why Wavelets?</h3>
				<p class="contentParagraph" align = "left">
					We use wavelets to decompose complicated signals or images into simpler parts,
					usually a sum of various wavelets with nice properties like those listed above.<br>
					Wavelets give fast, efficient algorithms for working with real data, and can provide pyscally intuitive
					interpretation of the signal to be studied.<br>

					Furthermore, a key advantage of using wavelets over Fourier transforms is that while the Fourier transform
					is a powerful tool for data analysis, it does not represent abrupt changes efficiently, as the data
					is represented as a sum of sine waves, which oscillates forever and are not localized.
					Since wavelets are well localized in time and frequency, they can be used to more accurately analyze
					signals and images that have abrupt changes.
